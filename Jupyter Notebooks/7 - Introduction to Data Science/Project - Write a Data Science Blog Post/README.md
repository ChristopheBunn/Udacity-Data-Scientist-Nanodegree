# Project - Write a Data Science Blog Post #
The **Udacity-Data-Scientist-Nanodegree** repository contains all material related to this Nanodegree program. This particular directory is dedicated to the project "Write a Data Science Blog Post".

## Motivation ##
Because I live in France, I decided to analyze Airbnb data for 3 French cities: **Bordeaux** (South-West, near the Atlantic Ocean), **Lyon** (East, near the Alps and Switzerland), and **Paris** (North, the capital). The data inspired me to ask the following questions:
1. Although all 3 cities are among the largest in the country, they differ a lot; is there a difference in the **price distribution** of Airbnb offerings?
2. Are **seasonal price fluctuations** different from one city to the other?
3. What are the **features** that **influence** the most the **price** of an Airbnb offering?

## Contents of the Directory ##
 - **Airbnb_Bordeaux_Lyon_Paris.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook containing all of the Python code for this project. For the sake of simplicity and because I've already missed the *soft deadline* by 3 weeks (!), there are no classes or functions. I would of course use these extensively in a less "hurried" context.
 - **Airbnb_Bordeaux_Lyon_Paris_20191007.html** for visualizing the Jupyter Notebook *via* a simple browser.

## Related Blog Post ##
The findings of the analysis contained in the Jupyter Notebook are the subject of a blog post on Medium: [Parlez-vous CRISP-DM ?]().
