Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Jupyter Notebooks, Data, and Notes

This Github repository holds most material which I used to complete this Nanodegree Program, terms 1 & 2. It's structured in the following way:

## Jupyter Notebooks
All Jupyter Notebooks used throughout the lessons.
Please note that this directory may also contain Project-specific directories, containing the Notebooks, data, documentation, etc.

## Datasets
Most datasets used in the Jupyter Notebooks; some may be missing, due to their large size.

## Documentation
Any general Nanodegree-related documentation.

## Scripts
Scripts (*e.g.*, Python, SQL) submitted by the instructor for completion, or used by me as scratch paper.

## README.md
The current file.
